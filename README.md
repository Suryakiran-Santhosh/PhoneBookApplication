# PhoneBookApplication

This is my final project in Advanced C++. This program uses advanced concepts such as vectors,
object-oreinted programming, encapuslation, and operator overloading. This is a command line project 
that acts as a Phonebook app.

Possible Future Changes:

  1.) a database to create persistence 
  
  2.) GUI 
  
  3.) give user ability to create a account
  
      -> create a web application to accompany the desktop app
